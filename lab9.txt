1.Basic Authentication and Session Authentication by default,It is managed by REST_FRAMEWORK object in the settings.py file.  key of 'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES' in REST_FRAMEWORK object holds the Authentication schema that rest framework will use.
2.Basic Authentication, since it is using the username and password and send them directly to the server
3.Token Authentication is sending a AuthToken to the server to verify you are have the credentials, whereas Session authentication is sending a csrf token to maintain your credentials for the duration of the csrf token,which is handle by server side. Token Authentication is improvement over Basic Authentication because of it uses Token instead of username and password in the header, which is more secure
4. Client send a user auth request to Google's Auth server, then user has to be authenticated in Google's Auth server and grant client permissions, then Google's Auth server send back Authorization Code to the client, then the client use Authorization Code to get a AccessToken, Google's Auth server send back Access Token, Then user are authenticated with the AccessToken Google's Auth server sent back.
